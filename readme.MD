# 01 Matrix Dashboard 🕶️

## 🎓 [01 Founders](https://01founders.co/) Project
This project is part of the innovative curriculum at 01 Founders - a revolutionary coding school that believes in peer-to-peer learning and project-based education. At 01 Founders, we don't just learn to code; we learn to think differently, solve problems creatively, and occasionally pretend we're in The Matrix! 

> "This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes..." 
> 
> — And yes, we actually added this to our dashboard! 🎭

## 🚀 What's This?

A super-cool GraphQL-powered dashboard for [01 Founders](https://01founders.co/) students to track their learning journey. Because who doesn't want to see their progress in a Matrix-style interface? This dashboard is more than just a tool - it's a reflection of the 01 Founders philosophy: learning should be engaging, challenging, and sometimes a bit nerdy! 🤓

### 🎮 Fun Features

- **Matrix Mode**: Take the red pill and watch your code stats in cyberpunk style
- **Christmas Mode**: 🎄 Because sometimes you need snowflakes with your algorithms
- **Real-time Stats**: XP tracking, project completion, and more!
- **SVG Graphs**: Pretty visualizations of your coding journey (way better than Excel!)

## 🔑 Getting Started

1. Visit our [Dashboard](https://01founders-dashboard.netlify.app/login.html)
2. Login with your 01 Founders credentials
3. Choose your pill:

   - 🎄 Green pill: Christmas mode (yes, we're keeping Christmas year-round!)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- GraphQL (because REST is so 2010)
- JWT Authentication (keeping your stats safe!)
- SVG Graphs (making data beautiful)
- Pure JavaScript (no frameworks, we're hardcore like that)
- CSS Magic (making things pretty)
- Matrix References (making things nerdy)

## 📊 Features

- User Profile Overview
- XP Progress Tracking
- Project Completion Stats
- Interactive SVG Graphs
- Skills Distribution
- Activity Heatmap
- And more Easter eggs! (keep clicking around...)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

We believe learning should be fun, so we added:
- Matrix-inspired design elements
- Christmas mode for festive coding
- Clean, dark theme UI (because we care about your eyes)
- Interactive elements that make data exploration enjoyable

## 🤓 Fun Fact

The Matrix theme wasn't in the project requirements, but we couldn't resist. After all, what's better than learning to code while pretending you're in The Matrix?
